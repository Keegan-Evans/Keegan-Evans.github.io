- Worked through and took notes on *Introduction to Buffer Overflows*,
  *Spiking*, and *Fuzzing* in Heath Adam's *Practical Ethical Hacking*
course on Udemy.

- 25 minutes reading through the previously mentioned [Building a Static
  Site with Jekyll and
Github](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#what-are-static-sites-jekyll-etc--why-might-i-care-)
and began working on setting up my own site.
