      <p>The last couple of weeks have been hectic, both nationally and
personally. I probably have let the national get too much in the way of
personal. I have been getting more studying done, but have been
prioritizing it over writing up what I am doing. This is not
the most positive, as I do tend to stay on track better when documenting
what I am working on.</p>

      <p>This week has been quite hectic, with a lot of it taken up continuing
to winterize our trailer, helping random friends with things, and school
for my son. The good news is that my son has gotten into one of the
school districts SAFE learning centers and so I should have more time to
focus on studying and applying for more jobs. I also have been working
on my resume, signing up for job fairs, and other job hunt related
things.</p>

      <ul>
  <li>Read <strong>Part V</strong> introduction and started on <strong>Chapter 17</strong> of <em>Simply
Scheme</em>. I was really excited about starting this part because it
actually feels like the book is diving into programming and not simply
providing a gentler introduction to it. Which is no criticism of the
gentle introduction, I feel very well prepared going into this
section, but this feels much more substantial and applicative to the
“real world” than previous sections have felt.</li>

  <li>The big thing was finishing exercise 16.20. This exercise felt quite
challenging, as it required understanding exactly how a function that
someone else wrote, and then expanding it using a function that was
similar required different inputs and a different set of recursions. I
may work on a write-up or video of it.</li>

      <p>I have decided to really focus on tackling studying for the CCNA for now,
with the goal of sitting for it near the end of the year. I also plan on
keeping up on my coding. That being said, there will probably be a bit
less variety on my progress for a while. I plan to continue working
throught <em>Simply Scheme</em> as well as random Python projects and some work
on my website. That said:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I completed <em>Subnetting Lab 2</em> (<strong>Section 12</strong>), looked over the cheat

  <li>Most of the morning I worked more on using requests and Beautiful Soup
to find all of the PDFs linked on a page and merge them into a single
one on the local drive. It does feel good to be doing this and only having
to look up documentation rather than puzzling over how to actually do
something. That may be a small step but it does feel like all of the time
studying up to this point that I have spent has begun to pay off. I still
need to work out how to get it to read pdfs from url’s.</li>

      <p>Today has solely consisted of playing around/struggling with the
hack-the-box devel machine. While there are write ups of how to do this
machine(including ones that I have done in the past, which I only have
a very foggy recollection of), I am trying to work through this as nearly
on my own as I can. I think I have a basic plan of attack and have been
able to get an unelevated shell by uploading a .asp webshell that I was
able to use to run a netcat shell that I hosted on a SMB server. Right now
I am reviewing my powershell knowledge(mostly as an excuse to do this,
I know that I could just look up the specifc way to do this) so that I can
try to run the sherlock.ps1 exploit discoverer from the smb server. I know
that I could use metasploit or the windows-vuln python script, but I would
like to see if I can get it to work doing it this way.</p>
