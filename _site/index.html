        <h1>Keegan Evans</h1>
        <p>This page is very much a work in progress. The blog section
        is a bit of an overview of the things that I have been working
        on. I have several articles written but I have not gotten the
        page holding them worked out to my satisfication. Stylistically,
        it is a bit of a disaster, but at this point the site is for
        learning and so that I have a place to hold a record of my daily
        activities for myself. In this regard it has been successful.</p>
