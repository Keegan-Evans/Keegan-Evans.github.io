    <p>Yesterday and today have been filled with lots and lots of work on getting my website looking not completely terrible. Or even just functioning. Somehow I had not realized that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">categories</code> tag was for creating directory structures, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tags</code> was what I was actually trying to use. This created problems when I tried to included the tag <em>Code: The Secret Language of Computers</em>, as it tried to create a directory with this name, which it could not, and would allow the website to generate.</p>

<p>I have also been working on the organization and styling of the website, which were in dire need of help. I probably should have used a theme, but as with most things in my life, I wanted the experience and control of doing it myself. So I am learning about SASS, CSS, and HTML. Which has been an interesting learning experience but doesn’t exactly lead me to believe strongly that I would like to be a web developer.</p>

fine. I think maybe I had copy and pasted part of the function from
the pdf of the text book and that the apostrophes had the wrong

    <p>Started <em>Simply Scheme</em> 19.11, the author says it is hard. I feel that. I
seemingly have made no progress. I feel as if I can’t quite articulate what I
am unable to do. Which I suspect is exactly where the problem lies, that is
if I could articulate it then I could solve it. Or rather the difficult part
of the problem is either actually saying what I am trying to do, or rather
the problem is actually know what I want to do. Isn’t it always. Or maybe I
just feel that way because I am reading Douglas Adam’s <em>The Hitchhikers Guide
to the Galaxy</em> right now…</p>

    <p>So far, everytime I go to write my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repeated</code> function, I end up not being
able to recurse, it is amazing how many times my brain can dream up the
same idea, and excitedly think that it has found a new way of tackling the
problem. Once I do manage to solve the problem, I plan to do a write up of
solving it, as I think that might help others who make it as far as I have
in the book and help cement the ideas in my head.</p>

- Spent a lot more time on Course Project for [*Genomic Data Science with
Galaxy*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project/home/welcome). I am
not so sure that this course is worth the time that I am putting into it.
While Galaxy seems like a good tool for doing genomic analyses and it does
provide good examples of reproducible workflows, I really only was doing the
course as a part of the certification. I may end up finishing it when I have
actually completed the other course in the specialization.

    <p>The last couple of weeks have been hectic, both nationally and
personally. I probably have let the national get too much in the way of
personal. I have been getting more studying done, but have been
prioritizing it over writing up what I am doing. This is not
the most positive, as I do tend to stay on track better when documenting
what I am working on.</p>

<p>In addition to the things that I had been doing before, I also have been
going over my resume and have started applying for jobs. This has become
a bit more of a realistic possibility as Gio has started attending a
“SAFE” learning center offered by the school district.</p>

<p>I have been focusing more on the coding side of things than
studying for the CCNA as that is the direction that I would like
to head, though I certainly am continuing to study for it.</p>

    <p>

    <p>This week has been quite hectic, with a lot of it taken up continuing
to winterize our trailer, helping random friends with things, and school
for my son. The good news is that my son has gotten into one of the
school districts SAFE learning centers and so I should have more time to
focus on studying and applying for more jobs. I also have been working
on my resume, signing up for job fairs, and other job hunt related
things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Finished through exercise 17.6 in <em>Simply Scheme</em>. So far, this
chapter has somehow felt more “real”, yet not to hard.<br />
  17.6 however asked you to implement a function that produced the
  same result as the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">append</code> scheme primitive, only using
  the list primitives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cons</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">car</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cdr</code>.<br />
  The whole thing seemed pretty straight forward, until I spent over 2
  days on this working trying to get it so that not only would it
  return a list of the same elements as the regular <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">append</code> function
  but so that it would do it in the correct order.</p>

    <p>I still don’t think my solution is as elegant or simplified as it
  could be, but it does function correctly. And while it doesn’t
  probably matter that it is optimized, as there is already a function
  for doing this, I think optimizing it would be helpful for my
  further understanding of using lists and help me think more deeply
  about the problem. Plus being satisfying…</p>

film on and shrinking it is very satisfying. The windows covered with
this film feel much warmer than the other ones.</p>

    <p>Read <strong>Part V</strong> introduction and started on <strong>Chapter 17</strong> of <em>Simply

actually feels like the book is diving into programming and not simply
providing a gentler introduction to it. Which is no criticism of the
gentle introduction, I feel very well prepared going into this
section, but this feels much more substantial and applicative to the
“real world” than previous sections have felt.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The big thing was finishing exercise 16.20. This exercise felt quite
challenging, as it required understanding exactly how a function that
someone else wrote, and then expanding it using a function that was
similar required different inputs and a different set of recursions. I
may work on a write-up or video of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read Chapter 2 of <a href="https://amzn.to/3dHP3P0">Wendell Odom’s CCNA
guide</a>. While the video courses feel a bit
easier and are maybe less “dry”(a common critique of Odom’s book), for
me anyways they are much harder to retain information or study from.
This book in particular is divided into chunks that are a great size
for studying. This makes sense as they are written with studying in
mind and have a section at the beginning that tells you exactly how
they are meant to be used.</p>

    <p>The reading sections of each chapter consist of around 1 - 1.5 hours
worth of material, and they have very clear review sections at the end
of each chapter. There are also other “review” subdivisions that I
will discuss when I get to them.</p>

    <p>My plan up to this point has been to read the chapter on one day and
then create Anki flash cards on the next day using the review section
as a guide. I will detail this process more later. As an aid to the
creation of flash cards, I also purchased the Premium Digital Edition
of the book directly through Pearson. The print version of the book
includes an excellent coupon for this that makes it very affordable.</p>

how to do it. I hope that means my brain is growing.</li>

<ul>
  <li>I did start working on <strong>Chapter 16 Example: Pattern Matcher</strong> from

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <p>Today has solely consisted of playing around/struggling with the
hack-the-box devel machine. While there are write ups of how to do this
machine(including ones that I have done in the past, which I only have
a very foggy recollection of), I am trying to work through this as nearly
on my own as I can. I think I have a basic plan of attack and have been
able to get an unelevated shell by uploading a .asp webshell that I was
able to use to run a netcat shell that I hosted on a SMB server. Right now
I am reviewing my powershell knowledge(mostly as an excuse to do this,
I know that I could just look up the specifc way to do this) so that I can
try to run the sherlock.ps1 exploit discoverer from the smb server. I know
that I could use metasploit or the windows-vuln python script, but I would
like to see if I can get it to work doing it this way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reading:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Finished throught the end of chapter 3 of <a href="https://amzn.to/2RPWSIj">The Explosive Child</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are a lot of strategies in here that I think will be helpful for
our somewhat aspie son. It is a bit funny as what the author (or at least
his editors) describes as an “explosive child” seems to fit the
description of children with Aspergers (mild ASD according to DSM 5)
exactly. It does make me wonder if many of the children labeled as
“explosive” or “difficult” really are Aspies at heart. A book title
<em>Learning to Mitigate the Meltdowns of Your Child With Asperger’s</em> would
sell considerably fewer copies though.</p>

    <p>Either way, it appears that many of the strategies and the mindset
that the author asserts are sound. He says they are backed up by years of
academic research. I haven’t had the chance to read the research he is
refering to. Or even to see if he has included citations in the back of
the book…yeah, I need to do that.</p>

    <p>However, trying to adopt the mind set that children that act like this
do not possess the tools to deal with many situations and therefore the
goal to have as a parent is to try to help the child gain the tools to
deal with a situation appears to be sound. I tried to engage this strategy
as best I understood it at bed time and to a situation involving a broken
flashlight. It seemed to be quite effective, he did a much better job
dealing with both situations when I was able to help him figure out how do
the things that he either wanted or knew that he needed to do. The topic
of <em>problem solving</em> may require its own post or series of posts in the
future.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I am quite impressed so far and highly recommend it to any parents
with either Aspies or “explosive” kids.</p>

I have found this exercise very challenging. From a top down

    <p>However, I am <del>strugg</del> working through a function to determine
straights and to sort the cards by rank. More specifically, I think
I understand how to implement a sort, but only if I have boolean primitive
that I can use to determine which of two values comes first. I am sure
that there is an easy solution that I am missing. Normally when I feel
like this, I have missed something simple. To that end, I am re-reading
the entire recursion section (section <em>IV</em>). I some ideas on how to
implement this boolean function, but hope clarify my thinking on this into

3 hours. It removed a ton more junk, but there still doesn’t seem to be

the coolant temp gauge inside. At this point we are going to ask on the
E30 forums if there should be coolant coming out of the bleeder

    <p>1.5 hours of work on the <em>Scoring Poker Hands</em> project in <strong>Simply
Scheme</strong>. Produced functions to deal with hands produced by matching
ranks. Next session I plan to develop a function to sort the ranks into
appropriate order and then score flush hands. Finally I can produce
a master function that will be able to determine the value of any given
hand.</p>

    <p>I was being driven crazy by the system beep tone whenever I accidently
entered an invalid keysequence or tried to tab to a file that didn’t
exist. I am running Kali Linux with the XFCE desktop. To turn it off, you
can open a terminal and enter: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xset -b</code>. To permanently turn off the tone
I created a startup program by going to Settings Manager -&gt; Session and
Startup -&gt; Application Autostart -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+ Add</code> With the settings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Name PC Speaker Off</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xset -b</code></p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> command of the day: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> is used to jump to a matching parenthesis,

as well as other matching keywords/conditionals if they are specified in

    <p>Worked through HTB: Lame without metasploit as OSCP practice. I ended up
writing my own python script for, though it looks a lot like other
available ones, though I wrote it for python 3.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="htb-lame-notes">HTB: Lame Notes</h3>

<p>A few further notes. An important part of the script is assignment of the
shellcode with the call:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>userID = "/=` nohup " + buf + "`"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two important things about this. The first does not actually
directly relate to this call itself but rather the msfvenom payload
referenced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code>. You need to be sure to delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> at the
beginning of each line that will tell python that it is byte code. By
removing this, python reads the line as a string and can therefore
concatenate it with the other strings you have supplied. The second is the
call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nohup</code> which is a linux command for “no hookup”. As best I can
tell, this is because we are trying to run our code between entering the
logon userID(which is what contains our code) and the system asking for
a password. To get the required time, we provide this command, which then
lets our other code run in the background. I will also include a few
resources that I read through after running through the box as much on my
own as I could:</p>

      <li>A few issues came up when trying to download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mona.py</code>
script. I had issues with cURL when trying to download it in my
Windows 10 environment. When I come up with a solution to this I will post
it. My second attempt was to simply use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> to create the file directly
in the directory. However, on my new install of Windows 10, I couldn’t
paste the text into vim. Look below for the fix to this.</li>

    <p>In the afternoon I helped flush the coolant system on a friend’s new
<strong><em>24 Hours of Lemons</em></strong> racecar. While flushing, we discovered that the
coolant system has several leaks and also does not seem to be running
coolant completely through the system very well. A “new” waterpump may be
in order. In this race series, that cost of the vehicle less the cost of
safety systems must be less than $500, which doesn’t leave much room for
anything approaching actually new parts.</p>

<p>Open Powershell as an Adminstrator, then use the vim command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>

    <p>Not much actual learning got done today, but it was fun:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Experimented with different themes for the blog. Some of them wouldn’t
work with Github Pages, including my favorite one. That was a little
disappointing, but provides a learning oppertunity, as I will probably
try to write a similar but compatible one!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Created a Google Analytics account. I did not get it setup on my
website, but at least I will be able to soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finished selling one of our cars. Not fun, but exciting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enjoyed the second day of very Autumnal weather with a bike ride with
the family. We rode to downtown, got coffee and muffins, and then rode
to Buffalo Park where we took a nice walk. Bike rides in Fall weather are
one of our favorite things!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had Buffalo Chicken and Instant Pot Mac and Cheese while watching <em>Star

<p>Not much on today, most of the limited time I got to work on anything on the computer was spent trying to figure out how to setup a website with Github pages, as I had essentially quite writing on my wordpress page because their “fancy” layout drove me crazy and I much prefer being able to write using vim and markdown, especially if it is combined with git/github. Apparently sometime in the past I created a repository for this but never set anything up on it. Well this evening I gave it a go, though that essentially consisted of writing a short intro and trying to figure out how to view it after deleting the default index page. Apparently I need to learn anything about how a website is actually setup, so I found the articles below that I plan to read when I get done with this. I want to have a site that is somewhat of a blog/homepage hybrid, hence the article choice. With that being said the day consisted of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Write introduction, activate github pages, delete default index file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wonder how to actually display anything.</p>
