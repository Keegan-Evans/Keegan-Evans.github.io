    <p>Continued working on <em>Simply Scheme</em> Project: Scoring Poker Hands.
I have found this exercise very challenging. From a top down
perspective, I have either figured out how to or actually written the code
to implement the program. I also have been able to write the code to
determine flushes and the various pair hands.</p>

    <p>However, I am <del>strugg</del> working through a function to determine
straights and to sort the cards by rank. More specifically, I think
I understand how to implement a sort, but only if I have boolean primitive
that I can use to determine which of two values comes first. I am sure
that there is an easy solution that I am missing. Normally when I feel
like this, I have missed something simple. To that end, I am re-reading
the entire recursion section (section <em>IV</em>). I some ideas on how to
implement this boolean function, but hope clarify my thinking on this into
something useful while reviewing.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Markdown notation of the day the <del>strike through</del>, by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~strike
through~~</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second Markdown notation tip of the day: You can create multi-paragraph
list items by including a blank line between the first and second
paragraphs of the list item and being sure to include at least one space
before the start of the second paragraph so that markdown will indent it
as part of the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> command of the day: Jump to the end of the previous line: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k$</code>.
Not really an independent command, or really difficult, but useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Began working on a script that would find and combine all of the PDF
files on a webpage. It may develop into full blown python module at some
point, but at this point it is going to live as a <a href="https://github.com/Keegan-Evans/kevans/blob/master/confluence.py">single python
script</a>
in my personal Github repository. As ancillary parts of this/general
coding knowledge, I will need to install and begin learning
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BeautifulSoup</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Requests</code>. At least.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read through a lot of the Jekyll websites documentation. I have both
some formating, functional, and stylistic changes that I want to make to
my website that I hope to be able to implement after reading the docs and
probably learning a bit more about CSS and HTML.</p>
