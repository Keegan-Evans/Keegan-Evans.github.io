<p>Not much actual learning got done today, but it was fun:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Experimented with different themes for the blog. Some of them wouldnâ€™t
work with Github Pages, including my favorite one. That was a little
disappointing, but provides a learning oppertunity, as I will probably
try to write a similar but compatible one!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Created a Google Analytics account. I did not get it setup on my
website, but at least I will be able to soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finished selling one of our cars. Not fun, but exciting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enjoyed the second day of very Autumnal weather with a bike ride with
the family. We rode to downtown, got coffee and muffins, and then rode
to Buffalo Park where we took a nice walk. Bike rides in Fall weather are
one of our favorite things!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had Buffalo Chicken and Instant Pot Mac and Cheese while watching <em>Star
Wars: A New Hope</em> with one of our friends.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
