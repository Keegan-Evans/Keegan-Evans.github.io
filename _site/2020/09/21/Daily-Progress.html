<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Got the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">straight?</code> predicate for the <em>scoring poker hands project
working</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Section 5</strong>: <em>Binary</em> from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/">David
Bombal’s</a>.
A lot of this was review, but I wanted to make sure that I didn’t have any
gaps in my knowledge for later in the course.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spent 2 hours playing with layouts and organizing pages on a “sandbox”
website to learn and practice organizing and formating pages with
Jekyll.</p>

    <p>Later, I would like to investigate whether it is possible to save links
on Jekyll sites so that I don’t have to enter the actual link over and
over. An example of where this would come in hand would be the links to
the various udemy courses that I am doing that I post each day discussing
what I did from the course.</p>

    <p>Additionally, I would like to see if there already exists the
functionality to automatically update a reading list from things I say
about the book or article in a post.I doubt that this already exists, but
would be a good project or challenge to have for myself. This would also
be handy for things like automatically updating my <a href="https://keeganevans.com/markdown-tips.html">Markdown
Tips</a> page from inside of
posts.</p>

    <p>Started trying to work through <em>Devel</em> from <strong>Hack the Box</strong> without
looking at any guides. It definitely is  a lot more challenging to work
through them from scratch, but a lot more fun! I have tried several things
out so far and I at least think I have an idea of where I have gone wrong.
I plan to work on it more first thing in the morning.</p>
