    <p><em>Generating Shellcode and Getting Root</em> in Heath Adam’s <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/"><em>Practical Ethical

    <p>1.5 hours of work on the <em>Scoring Poker Hands</em> project in <strong>Simply
Scheme</strong>. Produced functions to deal with hands produced by matching
ranks. Next session I plan to develop a function to sort the ranks into
appropriate order and then score flush hands. Finally I can produce
a master function that will be able to determine the value of any given
hand.</p>

    <p>Reread Chapter 2 of <strong>Simply Scheme</strong> for review.</p>

    <p>I was being driven crazy by the system beep tone whenever I accidently
entered an invalid keysequence or tried to tab to a file that didn’t
exist. I am running Kali Linux with the XFCE desktop. To turn it off, you
can open a terminal and enter: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xset -b</code>. To permanently turn off the tone
I created a startup program by going to Settings Manager -&gt; Session and
Startup -&gt; Application Autostart -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+ Add</code> With the settings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Name PC Speaker Off</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xset -b</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Trigger: on login</p>

    </ul>
  </li>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> command of the day: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> is used to jump to a matching parenthesis,
square bracket, or curly brace, the start or end of a C-style comment,
as well as other matching keywords/conditionals if they are specified in
ftplugin files.</p>

    <p>Worked through HTB: Lame without metasploit as OSCP practice. I ended up
writing my own python script for, though it looks a lot like other
available ones, though I wrote it for python 3.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="htb-lame-notes">HTB: Lame Notes</h3>

<p>A few further notes. An important part of the script is assignment of the
shellcode with the call:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>userID = "/=` nohup " + buf + "`"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two important things about this. The first does not actually
directly relate to this call itself but rather the msfvenom payload
referenced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buf</code>. You need to be sure to delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> at the
beginning of each line that will tell python that it is byte code. By
removing this, python reads the line as a string and can therefore
concatenate it with the other strings you have supplied. The second is the
call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nohup</code> which is a linux command for “no hookup”. As best I can
tell, this is because we are trying to run our code between entering the
logon userID(which is what contains our code) and the system asking for
a password. To get the required time, we provide this command, which then
lets our other code run in the background. I will also include a few
resources that I read through after running through the box as much on my
own as I could:</p>
