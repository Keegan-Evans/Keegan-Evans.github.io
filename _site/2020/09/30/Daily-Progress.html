        <h1> 30 Sep 2020 </h1>

<p>I have decided to really focus on tackling studying for the CCNA for now,
with the goal of sitting for it near the end of the year. I also plan on
keeping up on my coding. That being said, there will probably be a bit
less variety on my progress for a while. I plan to continue working
throught <em>Simply Scheme</em> as well as random Python projects and some work
on my website. That said:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I completed <em>Subnetting Lab 2</em> (<strong>Section 12</strong>), looked over the cheat
sheet in <strong>Section 13</strong>, and did <em>Subnetting VLOG #50</em> from <strong>Section
14</strong> of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start">David Bombalâ€™s CCNA
Course</a></li>
</ul>
