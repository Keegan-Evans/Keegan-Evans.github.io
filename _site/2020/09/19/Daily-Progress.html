  <li>
    <p><em>cracking the hash with Hashcat</em> from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/">Practical Ethical
Hacking</a>. This
ended up being more complicated than I thought as I ended up needing to
install NVIDIA CUDA and Visual Studio to try to get it running right.
I was not able to get it running successfully, I think my graphics card
may be too old and not compatible with hashcat. I am working on building
a new computer and hopefully this will not be an issue soon.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Left for a backpacking trip up Humphreys Peak in the Kachina Peaks in
Northern Arizona. We ended up getting started hiking around 1600, which
is definitely late, however, we arrived at tree line where we made camp
less than half an hour after dark.</p>
