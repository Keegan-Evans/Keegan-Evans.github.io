<ul>
  <li>I did not get much done as far as studying. The big story from the day
 was that this was the second day of an overnight backpacking trip up
Humphreys Peak with my family. We split it up into 2 days to make it
easier for my 7 year old son to make it. My wife and him were able to
sleep in until 8:30 or so, after which we got a leisurely start.</li>
