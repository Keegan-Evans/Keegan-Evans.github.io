        <p>The topic of escaping restricted shells I found really
intriguing from yesterday’s Linux PrivEsc article, and I was
able to find this <a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/escaping-restricted-linux-shells/">Escaping Restricted Linux
Shells</a>
article for today.</p>

    <p>Worked on the racecar cooling system again. After about 10 years of only
running water as the coolant, there is tons of rust and scale built up
in it. We rinsed it again and then let some CLR sit in it for about
3 hours. It removed a ton more junk, but there still doesn’t seem to be
much flow through the cooling system. We did finally get a temp reading on
the coolant temp gauge inside. At this point we are going to ask on the
E30 forums if there should be coolant coming out of the bleeder
immeadiately or not, which might change our approach. Barring any good
suggestions from the query, we will be replacing the thermostat,
thermostat housing, and water pump, as well as flushing all other lines
directly.</p>
