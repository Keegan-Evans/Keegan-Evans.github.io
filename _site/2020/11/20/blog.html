  <li>
    <p><em>Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics</em> chapter 2 exercises.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Started <em>Simply Scheme</em> 19.11, the author says it is hard. I feel that. I
seemingly have made no progress. I feel as if I can’t quite articulate what I
am unable to do. Which I suspect is exactly where the problem lies, that is
if I could articulate it then I could solve it. Or rather the difficult part
of the problem is either actually saying what I am trying to do, or rather
the problem is actually know what I want to do. Isn’t it always. Or maybe I
just feel that way because I am reading Douglas Adam’s <em>The Hitchhikers Guide
to the Galaxy</em> right now…</p>

    <p>So far, everytime I go to write my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repeated</code> function, I end up not being
able to recurse, it is amazing how many times my brain can dream up the
same idea, and excitedly think that it has found a new way of tackling the
problem. Once I do manage to solve the problem, I plan to do a write up of
solving it, as I think that might help others who make it as far as I have
in the book and help cement the ideas in my head.</p>
