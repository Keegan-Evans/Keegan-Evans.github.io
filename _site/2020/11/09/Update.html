        <h1> 09 Nov 2020 </h1>

<p>The last couple of weeks have been hectic, both nationally and
personally. I probably have let the national get too much in the way of
personal. I have been getting more studying done, but have been
prioritizing it over writing up what I am doing. This is not
the most positive, as I do tend to stay on track better when documenting
what I am working on.</p>

<p>In addition to the things that I had been doing before, I also have been
going over my resume and have started applying for jobs. This has become
a bit more of a realistic possibility as Gio has started attending a
“SAFE” learning center offered by the school district.</p>

<p>I have been focusing more on the coding side of things than
studying for the CCNA as that is the direction that I would like
to head, though I certainly am continuing to study for it.</p>
