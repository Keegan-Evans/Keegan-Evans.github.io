        <h1> 29 Nov 2020 </h1>

<p>Yesterday and today have been filled with lots and lots of work on getting my website looking not completely terrible. Or even just functioning. Somehow I had not realized that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">categories</code> tag was for creating directory structures, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tags</code> was what I was actually trying to use. This created problems when I tried to included the tag <em>Code: The Secret Language of Computers</em>, as it tried to create a directory with this name, which it could not, and would allow the website to generate.</p>

<p>I have also been working on the organization and styling of the website, which were in dire need of help. I probably should have used a theme, but as with most things in my life, I wanted the experience and control of doing it myself. So I am learning about SASS, CSS, and HTML. Which has been an interesting learning experience but doesnâ€™t exactly lead me to believe strongly that I would like to be a web developer.</p>
