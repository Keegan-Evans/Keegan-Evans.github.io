# Introduction

This is my personal page, mostly for the documentation of my journey into the IT/infosec world, but also of some of my other interests like bikes, fishing, and building things. I view the world as river that we are traveling along and there are many different experiences and challeneges that we can choose to embrace as we travel. This is small snippets of my story.
