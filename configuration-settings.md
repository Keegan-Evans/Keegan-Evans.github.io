## My Setup

I currently run Kali Linux 2020.3 with the xfce. This informs the choices
that I have made to my system. I would prefer to run GNOME desktop,
however xfce is much more stable in the vmware on my older system. 

### Swapping Caps Lock and Escape

Since I do the entirety of writing (both prose and code) in vim, I really
like having the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> and <kbd>ESC</kbd> keys swapped as
this makes changing modes much easier.
