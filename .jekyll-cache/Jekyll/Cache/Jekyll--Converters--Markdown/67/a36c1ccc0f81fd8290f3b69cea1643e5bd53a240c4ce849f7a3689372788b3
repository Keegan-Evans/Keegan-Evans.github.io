  <li><em>cracking the hash with Hashcat</em> from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/">Practical Ethical
Hacking</a>. This
ended up being more complicated than I thought as I ended up needing to
install NVIDIA CUDA and Visual Studio to try to get it running right.
I was not able to get it running successfully, I think my graphics card
may be too old and not compatible with hashcat. I am working on building
a new computer and hopefully this will not be an issue soon.</li>
