I":<p>Today was not particulary productive in regards to studying. Most of the
day was spent making preparations for our camping trip to San Onofre 
State Beach.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I did start working on <strong>Chapter 16 Example: Pattern Matcher</strong> from
<em>Simply Scheme</em>. I completed the first part of the chapter and started
on the exercises, of which I completed the first and started the
second.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<ul>
  <li>I also worked on getting vim setup in VScode. This included getting
extensions and <a href="https://github.com/Keegan-Evans/kevans/blob/master/swap-caps-escape.reg">setting up windows to swap CAP LOCK and ESC
keys</a></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<ul>
  <li>VIM tip of the day: To ensure there is a blank line between your
paragraphs, you can add the html tags for a paragraph:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>*paragraph one*

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*paragraph two*
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>There may be a more elegant way to do it, but this works!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
