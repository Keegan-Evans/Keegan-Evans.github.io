  <li>The reading portion of Chapter 1 in <a href="https://amzn.to/3dHP3P0">Wendell Odomâ€™s CCNA
guide</a>. I started this because I think I do
much better studying from a book rather than just the videos. I plan
to watch the videos first to get a high-level overview, then read the
equivalent sections of the book. I was driving my self crazy scrolling
back to get particular commands or to hear a detailed explanation again.</li>
