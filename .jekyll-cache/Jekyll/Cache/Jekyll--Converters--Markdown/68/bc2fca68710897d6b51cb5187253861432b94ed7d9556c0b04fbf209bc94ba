I"µ<p>This week has been quite hectic, with a lot of it taken up continuing
to winterize our trailer, helping random friends with things, and school
for my son. The good news is that my son has gotten into one of the
school districts SAFE learning centers and so I should have more time to
focus on studying and applying for more jobs. I also have been working
on my resume, signing up for job fairs, and other job hunt related
things.</p>
