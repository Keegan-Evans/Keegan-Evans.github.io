  <li>
    <p>Finished Chapter 18 exercises from <em>Simply Scheme</em>.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Spent a lot more time on Course Project for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project/home/welcome"><em>Genomic Data Science
with
Galaxy</em></a>.
I am not so sure that this course is worth the time that I am putting
into it. While Galaxy seems like a good tool for doing genomic
analysis and it does provide good examples of reproducible workflows,
I really only was doing the course as a part of the certification. I
may end up finishing it when I have actually completed the other
course in the specialization.</p>
