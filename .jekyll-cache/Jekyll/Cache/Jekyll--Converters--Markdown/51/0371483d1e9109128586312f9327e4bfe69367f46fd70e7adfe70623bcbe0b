I"j<p>The last couple of weeks have been hectic, both nationally and
personally. I probably have let the national get too much in the way of
personal. I have been getting more studying done, but have been
prioritizing it over writing up what I am doing. This is not
the most positive, as I do tend to stay on track better when documenting
what I am working on.</p>
