  <li>Most of the morning I worked more on using requests and Beautiful Soup
to find all of the PDFs linked on a page and merge them into a single
one on the local drive. It does feel good to be doing this and only having
to look up documentation rather than puzzling over how to actually do
something. That may be a small step but it does feel like all of the time
studying up to this point that I have spent has begun to pay off. I still
need to work out how to get it to read pdfs from urlâ€™s.</li>
