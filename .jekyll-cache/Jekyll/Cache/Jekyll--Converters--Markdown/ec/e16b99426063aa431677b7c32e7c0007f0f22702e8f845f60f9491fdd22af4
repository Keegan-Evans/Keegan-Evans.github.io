I"H<p>This site is for documenting the many adventures and projects in my life. The main focus will be on my journey into the IT/infosec world. I also anticipate there will be pieces on programming,  electronics, bicycles, cars, camping, hiking, climbing, canyoneering, fishing, conservation,  making, building, and gardening.</p>
