I"[<p>Today has solely consisted of playing around/struggling with the
hack-the-box devel machine. While there are write ups of how to do this
machine(including ones that I have done in the past, which I only have
a very foggy recollection of), I am trying to work through this as nearly
on my own as I can. I think I have a basic plan of attack and have been
able to get an unelevated shell by uploading a .asp webshell that I was
able to use to run a netcat shell that I hosted on a SMB server. Right now
I am reviewing my powershell knowledge(mostly as an excuse to do this,
I know that I could just look up the specifc way to do this) so that I can
try to run the sherlock.ps1 exploit discoverer from the smb server. I know
that I could use metasploit or the windows-vuln python script, but I would
like to see if I can get it to work doing it this way.</p>
