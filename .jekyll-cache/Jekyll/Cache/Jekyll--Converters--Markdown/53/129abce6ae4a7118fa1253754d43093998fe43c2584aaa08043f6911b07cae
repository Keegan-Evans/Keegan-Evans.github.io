    <p>Went over how to format websites using Jekyll, first practicing on my
local “sandbox” website. Actually, very first, I installed Ruby and
Jekyll on my Windows machine. I am still really liking the VSCode/VIM
combo. I have also started on an article about organizing your Jekyll
pages. All of the information is in the documentation, but I think at
least for myself it will be handy for the future.</p>
