    <p>Installed VM Windows server and client machines. Setup an Active
Directory Forest. This was very challenging for me at this point, as
I have not ever actually worked with Active Directory before. It is
something that I have known is important and I am very excited to be
getting to work with it. The process that I actually went through is
detailed in <em>Setting Up the Domain Controller</em>, <em>Setting Up the User
Machines</em>, <em>Setting Up Users, Groups, and Policies</em>, and <em>Joining Our
Machines to the Domain</em> from <strong>Section 16</strong> of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/learn/lecture/17151532#content">Heath Adamâ€™s Practical Ethical Hacking
Course</a>.
Except that I used a <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> theme. I am really excited to
start in on the exploits tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Replaced the tempered glass screen on my tablet after stress cracking
it the other day. I nearly completely messed it up with several pieces
of dust falling onto the screen between removing dust with tape and laying
the screen down, despite being all of the about 8 seconds. The dry air
here in Flagstaff can make this challenging. It took around 4 tries to get
it all off, which is risky, as you risk removing the sticky from the
protector or cracking it, but can be done very carefully.</p>
