    <p>Transfered domain registrar from Wordpress to Google Domains, set up DNS

    <p>Worked through and took notes on <em>Finding the Offset</em>, <em>Overwriting the
EIP</em>, and <em>Finding Bad Characters</em> in Heath Adam’s <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/"><em>Practical Ethical
Hacking</em></a> course

      <li>When working through <em>Finding Bad Characters</em>, when providing
the list of bad characters, be sure to delete the valuen “\x00”
as it is a known bad character and will mess up the rest of your results
if left in. I was pulling my hair out trying to figure this out.</li>
