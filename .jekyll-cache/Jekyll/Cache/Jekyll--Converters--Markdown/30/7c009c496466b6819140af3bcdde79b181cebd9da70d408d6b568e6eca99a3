I"k<p>This week has been quite hectic, with a lot of it taken up continuing
to winterize our trailer, helping random friends with things, and school
for my son. The good news is that my son has gotten into one of the
school districts SAFE learning centers and so I should have more time to
focus on studying and applying for more jobs. I also have been working
on my resume, signing up for job fairs, and other job hunt related
things.</p>

    <p>Finished through exercise 17.6 in <em>Simply Scheme</em>. So far, this
chapter has somehow felt more “real”, yet not to hard.<br />
  17.6 however asked you to implement a function that produced the
  same result as the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">append</code> scheme primitive, only using
  the list primitives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cons</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">car</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cdr</code>.<br />
  The whole thing seemed pretty straight forward, until I spent over 2
  days on this working trying to get it so that not only would it
  return a list of the same elements as the regular <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">append</code> function
  but so that it would do it in the correct order.</p>

    <p>I still don’t think my solution is as elegant or simplified as it
  could be, but it does function correctly. And while it doesn’t
  probably matter that it is optimized, as there is already a function
  for doing this, I think optimizing it would be helpful for my
  further understanding of using lists and help me think more deeply
  about the problem. Plus being satisfying…</p>
