    <p>Read <strong>Part V</strong> introduction and started on <strong>Chapter 17</strong> of <em>Simply
Scheme</em>. I was really excited about starting this part because it
actually feels like the book is diving into programming and not simply
providing a gentler introduction to it. Which is no criticism of the
gentle introduction, I feel very well prepared going into this
section, but this feels much more substantial and applicative to the
‚Äúreal world‚Äù than previous sections have felt.</p>
