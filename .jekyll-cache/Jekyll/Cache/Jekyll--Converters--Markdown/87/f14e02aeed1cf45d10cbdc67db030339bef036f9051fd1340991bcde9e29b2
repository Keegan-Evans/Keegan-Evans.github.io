    <p>The big thing was finishing exercise 16.20. This exercise felt quite
challenging, as it required understanding exactly how a function that
someone else wrote, and then expanding it using a function that was
similar required different inputs and a different set of recursions. I
may work on a write-up or video of it.</p>

    <p>Read Chapter 2 of <a href="https://amzn.to/3dHP3P0">Wendell Odom‚Äôs CCNA
guide</a>. While the video courses feel a bit
easier and are maybe less ‚Äúdry‚Äù(a common critique of Odom‚Äôs book), for
me anyways they are much harder to retain information or study from.
This book in particular is divided into chunks that are a great size
for studying. This makes sense as they are written with studying in
mind and have a section at the beginning that tells you exactly how
they are meant to be used.</p>

    <p>The reading sections of each chapter consist of around 1 - 1.5 hours
worth of material, and they have very clear review sections at the end
of each chapter. There are also other ‚Äúreview‚Äù subdivisions that I
will discuss when I get to them.</p>

    <p>My plan up to this point has been to read the chapter on one day and
then create Anki flash cards on the next day using the review section
as a guide. I will detail this process more later. As an aid to the
creation of flash cards, I also purchased the Premium Digital Edition
of the book directly through Pearson. The print version of the book
includes an excellent coupon for this that makes it very affordable.</p>
