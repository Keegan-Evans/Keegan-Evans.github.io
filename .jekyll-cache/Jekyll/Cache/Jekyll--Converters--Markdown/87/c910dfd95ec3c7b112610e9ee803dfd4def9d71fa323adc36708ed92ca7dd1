    <p>In an effort imolate myself up on the <em>Altar of Diving Down Rabbit
Holes</em>, I continued watched <a href="https://youtu.be/sQm4zRvvX58">Powershell
Fundamentals</a> from the <em>Powershell Master
Class</em> by John Savill.</p>

    <p>Most of the day was spent on school work with the kiddo. A difficult but
productive day. The lessonâ€™s from <a href="https://amzn.to/2RPWSIj">The Explosive
Child</a> served me well.</p>

    <p>Chapter 8 of <a href="https://amzn.to/3hZRUmR">The Twilight of the Gods: War in the Western Pacific,

    <p>Worked on creating a custom color palette for my website. Found
a palette that I liked and then I saved it in a format that I think will
work. That is a late morning project for tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Completed the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/">Basic

    <p>Helped disassemble the cooling system of the racecar. There was nothing
obvious wrong with it upon disassembly, though it did not seem to be
flowing coolant when we tested it the other day. It is getting a new water
pump, new thermostat, and new thermostat housing when Joey gets back. We
will probably remove the thermostat from the housing to flush it. As is
ever the case, we discovered that to replace the thermostat housing,
removing the fuel rail would be necessary. Which may or may not requiring
removing all of the headers. We shall hope not.</p>
