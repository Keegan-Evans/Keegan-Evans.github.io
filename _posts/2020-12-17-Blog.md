Started reading through *Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics*. While
working up at Second Mesa this week, I installed Anaconda and the
required packages on a Linux VM. One thing that I plan to do differently
than the book is to use Ipython and python files to work through it and
then export it to an ipynb, as I like to be able to edit with VIM rather
than in a notebook.
