title: Enjoying the Beginning of Autumn
---

Not much actual learning got done today, but it was fun:

- Experimented with different themes for the blog. Some of them wouldn't
  work with Github Pages, including my favorite one. That was a little
disappointing, but provides a learning oppertunity, as I will probably
try to write a similar but compatible one!

- Created a Google Analytics account. I did not get it setup on my
  website, but at least I will be able to soon.

- Finished selling one of our cars. Not fun, but exciting.

- Enjoyed the second day of very Autumnal weather with a bike ride with
  the family. We rode to downtown, got coffee and muffins, and then rode
to Buffalo Park where we took a nice walk. Bike rides in Fall weather are
one of our favorite things! 

- Had Buffalo Chicken and Instant Pot Mac and Cheese while watching *Star
  Wars: A New Hope* with one of our friends.
