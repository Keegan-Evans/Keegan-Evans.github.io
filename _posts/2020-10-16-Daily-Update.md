- **Section 19: Duplex and Speed Mismatch Demo** from [David Bombal's CCNA
  Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start).

- *Simply Scheme*, pp267-275, including copying out and carefully
  working through the chapter 16 program in my mind. I feel like I am
  finally getting my head around this chapter. Bring on the exercises
  tomorrow!

- Went over how to format websites using Jekyll, first practicing on my
  local "sandbox" website. Actually, very first, I installed Ruby and
  Jekyll on my Windows machine. I am still really liking the VSCode/VIM
  combo. I have also started on an article about organizing your Jekyll
  pages. All of the information is in the documentation, but I think at
  least for myself it will be handy for the future.

  - ***Vim Command of the Day***: ```^``` jumps or tells the action to
    jump to the first character in the line.
