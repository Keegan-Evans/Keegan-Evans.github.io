- **Section 19: Duplex and Speed Mismatch Demo** from [David Bombal's
CCNA
  Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start).

- *Simply Scheme*, pp267-275, including copying out and carefully
  working through the chapter 16 program in my mind. I feel like I am
  finally getting my head around this chapter. Bring on the exercises
  tomorrow!

- Went over how to format websites using Jekyll, first practicing on my
  local "sandbox" website. Well, very first I actually installed Jekyll
  on my Windows machine. I am still really liking the VSCode/VIM combo.
