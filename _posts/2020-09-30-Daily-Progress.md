I have decided to really focus on tackling studying for the CCNA for now,
with the goal of sitting for it near the end of the year. I also plan on
keeping up on my coding. That being said, there will probably be a bit
less variety on my progress for a while. I plan to continue working
throught *Simply Scheme* as well as random Python projects and some work
on my website. That said:
- I completed *Subnetting Lab 2* (**Section 12**), looked over the cheat
  sheet in **Section 13**, and did *Subnetting VLOG #50* from **Section
14** of [David Bombal's CCNA
Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start)
