- Finished *Simply Scheme* exercise 16.2. It was definitely of those
  instanances where the when I started working on the problem I had no
  idea why it wasn't working and now this morning it was really obvious
  how to do it. I hope that means my brain is growing.

- More of an observation, but I am really enjoying using VScode with
  VIM, much more so than either of them on their own.
