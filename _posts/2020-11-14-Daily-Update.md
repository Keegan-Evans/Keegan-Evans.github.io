- Finished Chapter 18 exercises from *Simply Scheme*.

- Spent a lot more time on Course Project for [*Genomic Data Science with
Galaxy*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project/home/welcome). I am
not so sure that this course is worth the time that I am putting into it.
While Galaxy seems like a good tool for doing genomic analysis and it does
provide good examples of reproducible workflows, I really only was doing the
course as a part of the certification. I may end up finishing it when I have
actually completed the other course in the specialization.
