- Started a music page for my website of some of my favorite music. 

- Spent a long time working towards the *Scoring Poker Hands* project from
  *Simply Scheme*. I started defining the master function and also
a predicate function for determining if it is a straight or not. I may
just be really tired, but this has been quite a bit more challenging than
I thought it would be. 

- *Life is more complicated: Tips and Tricks*, All four videos(17-20) for
  the *Practical TCP/IP Model*, and the TCP/IP model quiz from [David Bombal's CCNA
course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/).

- **Section 17**: *Introduction*, *LLMNR Poisoning Overview*, and
  *Capturing NTLMv2 Hashes with Responder* [Heath Adam's Practical Ethical Hacking
Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/learn/lecture/17151532#content).
<!---I had a bit of difficultly with getting Responder to work, as the default
Impacket version is differenct from what Heath shows. I will have a write
up on how I fixed this
