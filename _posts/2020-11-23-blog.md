- Finished chapter 4 of *Python for Data Analysis*
- Read/worked through chapter 20 of *Simply Scheme* up to start the
  section **Tic-Tac-Toe Revisited**, where I ran into an error where I
  believe my square procedure kept returning `#f` instead of the
  function name when the `stupid-ttt` was called.
