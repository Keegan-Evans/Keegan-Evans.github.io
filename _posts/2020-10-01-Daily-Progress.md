Today was not particulary productive in regards to studying. Most of the
day was spent making preparations for our camping trip to San Onofre 
State Beach.

- I did start working on **Chapter 16 Example: Pattern Matcher** from
  *Simply Scheme*. I completed the first part of the chapter and started
  on the exercises, of which I completed the first and started the
  second.   

<p></p>

- I also worked on getting vim setup in VScode. This included getting
  extensions and [setting up windows to swap CAP LOCK and ESC
  keys](https://github.com/Keegan-Evans/kevans/blob/master/swap-caps-escape.reg)

<p></p>

- VIM tip of the day: To ensure there is a blank line between your
  paragraphs, you can add the html tags for a paragraph:
  ```
  *paragraph one*

  <p></p>

  *paragraph two*
  ```
  There may be a more elegant way to do it, but this works!
