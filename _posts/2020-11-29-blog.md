Yesterday and today have been filled with lots and lots of work on getting my
website looking not completely terrible. Or even just functioning. Somehow I
had not realized that the `categories` tag was for creating directory
structures, while `tags` was what I was actually trying to use. This created
problems when I tried to included the tag
*Code: The Secret Language of Computers*, as it tried to create a
directory with this name, which it could not, and would allow the website to
generate.
I have also been working on the organization and styling of the
website, which were in dire need of help. I probably should have used a
theme, but as with most things in my life, I wanted the experience and
control of doing it myself. So I am learning about SASS, CSS, and HTML.
Which has been an interesting learning experience but doesn't exactly
lead me to believe strongly that I would like to be a web developer.
