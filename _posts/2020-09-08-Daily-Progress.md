- Transfered domain registrar from Wordpress to Google Domains, set up DNS
  and an enabled https.

- Worked through and took notes on *Finding the Offset*, *Overwriting the
  EIP*, and *Finding Bad Characters* in Heath Adam's [*Practical Ethical
Hacking*](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) course
on Udemy.

	- When working through *Finding Bad Characters*, when providing
	  the list of bad characters, be sure to delete the valuen "\x00"
as it is a known bad character and will mess up the rest of your results
if left in. I was pulling my hair out trying to figure this out.
