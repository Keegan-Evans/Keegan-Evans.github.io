## To start

Started the day off skiing the first good snow we have had this year with
Joey. A gentle white out and lots of soft, lumpy snow with bits of untouched
powder to be found. I definitely am not as smooth in the soft snow as as I
would like yet, but it was fun. Fatter skies would help.

## Work

Wrapping up release activities, which while tedious took Liz and I a lot less
time than it has historically. Not much other than responding to forum posts
and some reading:

- [A One-Stop Shop for Principal Component Analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c) turned out to be a pretty good overview of PCA.
- [Species abundance information improves sequence taxonomy classification
