- The reading portion of Chapter 1 in [Wendell Odom's CCNA
  guide](https://amzn.to/3dHP3P0). I started this because I think I do
  much better studying from a book rather than just the videos. I plan
  to watch the videos first to get a high-level overview, then read the
  equivalent sections of the book. I was driving my self crazy scrolling
  back to get particular commands or to hear a detailed explanation again.

- **Section 21: TCP UDP**, videos 103-108. [David Bombal's CCNA Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start).
