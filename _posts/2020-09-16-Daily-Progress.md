- *Networking Devices: Firewalls, IDS, IPS, and WLC* and *OSI and TCP/IP
  Models* from [David Bombal's CCNA
course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/)

- [The Problem with Cybersecurity
  Hiring](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-problem-with-cybersecurity-hiring/)

- Installed VM Windows server and client machines. Setup an Active
  Directory Forest. This was very challenging for me at this point, as
I have not ever actually worked with Active Directory before. It is
something that I have known is important and I am very excited to be
getting to work with it. The process that I actually went through is
detailed in *Setting Up the Domain Controller*, *Setting Up the User
Machines*, *Setting Up Users, Groups, and Policies*, and *Joining Our
Machines to the Domain* from **Section 16** of [Heath Adam's Practical Ethical Hacking
Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/learn/lecture/17151532#content).
Except that I used a **Lord of the Rings** theme. I am really excited to
start in on the exploits tomorrow.

- Replaced the tempered glass screen on my tablet after stress cracking
  it the other day. I nearly completely messed it up with several pieces
of dust falling onto the screen between removing dust with tape and laying
the screen down, despite being all of the about 8 seconds. The dry air
here in Flagstaff can make this challenging. It took around 4 tries to get
it all off, which is risky, as you risk removing the sticky from the
protector or cracking it, but can be done very carefully.

- Read the chapter on formatting in [Jon Duckett's HTML and
  CSS](https://amzn.to/3c6KP2C) (affiliate) in preparation for working on
a body template for my website tomorrow.
