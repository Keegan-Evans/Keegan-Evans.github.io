- Worked on the Course Project for [*Genomic Data Science with Galaxy*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project/home/welcome).

- Finished 18.5! I ended up re-writing my lateral function to do the
  passing over instead of my depth-wise function, which allowed me to
  eliminate the blank lists that I had kept ending up with before.
