- Started **Section 19: Duplex and Speed Mismatch Demo** from [David
  Bombal's CCNA
  Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start).
  For some reason I could not concentrate on this at all. I went through
  the first 2 videos of this section but I think I will be going over
  them again tomorrow.

- pgs 261-267 (up to the **Abstract Data Types** section) of *Simply Scheme*.
