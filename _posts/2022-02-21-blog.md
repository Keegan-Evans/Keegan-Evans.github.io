There were essentially just 2 things that happened today:

1. Finished reading chapter 7 from _Digital Computer Electronics_.
2. Finished up the QIIME2-2022.2 release.

_DCE_ has thus far been a very straight forward look at how computers operate
at the level of the metal. Ch 7 was on flip-flops, which while not the most
interesting chapter is a crucial foundational piece for being able to store
information. Working through this book really has improved my mental model of
how a computer fundementally operates.

Considering that Matt is now on his sabattical, this release has gone pretty
smoothly. For the most part it feels like Liz and I are able to do most things
and are pretty quick to figure out when we _do not know_. It is nice to be
able to fail fast.
