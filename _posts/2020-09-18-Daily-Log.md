the cumulative war against the Japanese during WWII. This is in oposition

Air Force's strategic bombing campaign against the Japanese home islands,
a broad strokes overview of the allied submarine commerce raiding campaign
against the Japanese merchant marine, filled out with the stories of a few
noteworthy examples of this type of warfare, a brief discussion of the
saga of the US Navy's torpedos, and the narative of the sinking of the the
*Shinano* (the largest warship to ever be sunk by a submarine).
