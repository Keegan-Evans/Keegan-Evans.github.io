- This week has consisted of a bunch more skiing and playing in the snow here in Flagstaff. My skiing has improved dramatically and I feel like I can confidently and aggressively all of the blue slopes on the mountain, with even carving turns. I have found this to be immensely satisfying.
- Feeling as though I have completed most of the conceptual material in *Simply Scheme*, I have decided that I am done with it for now. If the end-point of my reading was to learn the material to the level that is taught in *Simply Scheme*, then I would go ahead and finish it. However, my goal all along has been to use it as prerequisite/preparatory work for *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*. I started this book today, finishing up through **1.1.7**
- Did **Problems/Computer Lab:** 4-1 from *Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics*
- Read [this](https://powershell.one/tricks/filesystem/finding-duplicate-files) on determining if the contents of a file are identical based on the file hash. A have several directories that I think have matching files but with different names and I plan to write a script sometime this week to work on cleaning this situation up. I really don't want to have to duplicates but I also really don't want to have to go through by hand to determine which are the same as there a quite a few files in these directories
