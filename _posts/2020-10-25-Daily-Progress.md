- Exercises through 17.4 of *Simply Scheme*.

- Spent a good chunk of the morning looking for jobs and working on my resume.

- The afternoon was spent getting our trailer ready for winter, with the
  first night below 20&#176;f. We are trying a skirt made from a
  non-woven house wrap this year. I also covered some of our windows
  with clear film. The taping for these was tedious, but putting the
  film on and shrinking it is very satisfying. The windows covered with
  this film feel much warmer than the other ones.
