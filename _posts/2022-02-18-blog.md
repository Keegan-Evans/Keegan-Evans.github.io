### Subsampling script

Ok, the subsampling script that I had been plannin on working on yesterday did
not really go anywhere then, though I did get the q2-dada2 expected data
output setup. So here we go on the subsampling stuff. Here are some design
points:

- Inputs: a manifest of the fastq files and the desired number of reads
  from each.

- create directory to store subsampled files.

- read files from manifest and subsample them one at a time.

- If any of the fastqs are unzipped, unzip them(maybe un-necessary if `sk-bio`
  can read compressed files.

- Open each file using `skbio.io.read`

- reservoir sample each file to the target number of reads. This function
  should be a generator that takes the read file generator as input.

- write back out to file in the subsampled directory.

- compress new file(maybe handled by skbio?)

- write entry in a subsampled manifest.
