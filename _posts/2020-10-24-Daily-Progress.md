- Read **Part V** introduction and started on **Chapter 17** of *Simply
  Scheme*. I was really excited about starting this part because it
  actually feels like the book is diving into programming and not simply
  providing a gentler introduction to it. Which is no criticism of the
  gentle introduction, I feel very well prepared going into this
  section, but this feels much more substantial and applicative to the
  "real world" than previous sections have felt.
