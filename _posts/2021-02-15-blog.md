- More carefully worked through SICP exercise 1.19 more carefully and
  think that I finally at-least sort of grok what is going on. I at
  least was able to get the correct values for $q_1$ and $p_1$ so that
  the function works correctly. 

- Yep, more playing with snippets and $\LaTeX$. I also plan on
  documenting how I got this setup.
