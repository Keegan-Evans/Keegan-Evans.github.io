There was a bit of a break there as I was preparing for/on vacation with
the family. I spent three days before leaving working on our van/ putting
in a new bed in the back of it. 

We spent the time camping at San Mateo Campground at San Onofre State
Beach. For day trips we snorkeled and paddleboarded at La Jolla and then
spent several days just playing on the beach, fish, boogie boarding, and
surfing at San Clemente and Doheny.
