- Got the `play-ttt` function. I am not sure exactly how, I downloaded a
  fresh copy of ttt.scm from the book website and deleted and re-entered
  the apparent offenders in the function and it seems to be working
  fine. I think maybe I had copy and pasted part of the function from
  the pdf of the text book and that the apostrophes had the wrong
  encoding...but I am not sure.

- Read the section on PAM Scoring Matrices from *Bioinformatics and
  Functional Genomics*.

- Worked problems on [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) for 35 minutes.

- Chapter 6.1 from "Python for Data Analysis"
