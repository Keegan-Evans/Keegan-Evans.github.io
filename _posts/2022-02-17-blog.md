### q2-dada2


Work on scripts to automate the production of test data for the smoke-screen
tests in `q2-dada2`.

The first of these are used to subset data from larger fastq files, so that
these smaller datasets can be run in a reasonable amount of time. Eventually
this might be added to `dev tools`.

The other essentially hack into the `_denoise_helper` function and write the
raw data to `.fasta` and `.tsv` files when running denoise. This data than can
be used as the expected data for the tests.

### Helpful Vim thingy:

`:set list`

shows whitespaces!
