- In *Simply Scheme* I finished the chapter 21 exercises and read
  chapter 22. Chapter 21 really seemed like a bit of drag/it felt a bit
  irrelevant/busy work. However on reading chapter 22, it seems like it
  has at least set some groundwork for other stuff, even if it is only
  directly applicable in Scheme.
