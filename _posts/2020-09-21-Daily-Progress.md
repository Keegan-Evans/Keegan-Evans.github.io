- Got the `straight?` predicate for the *scoring poker hands project
  working*.

- **Section 5**: *Binary* from [David
  Bombal's](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/).
A lot of this was review, but I wanted to make sure that I didn't have any
gaps in my knowledge for later in the course. 

- Spent 2 hours playing with layouts and organizing pages on a "sandbox"
  website to learn and practice organizing and formating pages with
Jekyll. 

 Later, I would like to investigate whether it is possible to save links
on Jekyll sites so that I don't have to enter the actual link over and
over. An example of where this would come in hand would be the links to
the various udemy courses that I am doing that I post each day discussing
what I did from the course. 

 Additionally, I would like to see if there already exists the
functionality to automatically update a reading list from things I say
about the book or article in a post.I doubt that this already exists, but
would be a good project or challenge to have for myself. This would also
be handy for things like automatically updating my [Markdown
Tips](https://keeganevans.com/markdown-tips.html) page from inside of
posts.
