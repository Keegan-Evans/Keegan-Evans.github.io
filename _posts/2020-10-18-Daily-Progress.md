- Finished **Section 20** from [David Bombal's CCNA
  Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start).
  I forgot about making sure to turn telnet on, for the first video and
  was pulling my hair out trying to get it to work. 

  For future me and everyone else who has forgotten how to do this:

  ```
  line vty 0 4
  password YOUR_PASSWORD
  login
  ```
- 16.12 from *Simply Scheme*.

- Started working on a post about organizing a website using Jekyll.
