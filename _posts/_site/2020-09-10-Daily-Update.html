      <li>A few issues came up when trying to download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mona.py</code>
script. I had issues with cURL when trying to download it in my
Windows 10 environment. When I come up with a solution to this I will post
it. My second attempt was to simply use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vim</code> to create the file directly
in the directory. However, on my new install of Windows 10, I couldn’t
paste the text into vim. Look below for the fix to this.</li>

    <p>In the afternoon I helped flush the coolant system on a friend’s new
<strong><em>24 Hours of Lemons</em></strong> racecar. While flushing, we discovered that the
coolant system has several leaks and also does not seem to be running
coolant completely through the system very well. A “new” waterpump may be
in order. In this race series, that cost of the vehicle less the cost of
safety systems must be less than $500, which doesn’t leave much room for
anything approaching actually new parts.</p>

<p>Open Powershell as an Adminstrator, then use the vim command:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
:edit $MYVIMRC

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which will edit your .vimrc whereever it is then added this to it:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim

behave mswin

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then save via the usual route.</p>
