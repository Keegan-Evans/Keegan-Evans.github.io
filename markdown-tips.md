This is a collection of tips and information for writing with markdown.  


## Making Key Symbols

Because markdown can also accept html input, you can use the html keyboard
tag to create key symbols:

```
<kbd>ESC</kbd>
```

makes the symbol: <kbd>ESC</kbd>.  


## Using Unicode Characters

You can specify unicode characters to be displayed in your Markdown
document. You must know the numberical HTML code. [This
Page](https://www.utf8-chartable.de/) is my go-to reference for finding
these. Be sure to select `decimal` under `numerical HTML encoding of the
Unicode character` to get the correct code.  

```
&#10230;
```


produces a right facing arrow or &#10230;
