title: Writing with LaTeX in NVIM - Introduction
---

This is the first of a set of articles on writing using VIM and $\LaTeX$
to author various types of documents. 

## Why NVIM?

In my case, because I really like editing with VIM and I like the
ecosystem of plugins that allow for easy and powerful customization that
allow NVIM to serve as powerful IDE as well as a fast and universal text
editor. For more of an explination of this look for [my VIM
series](https://keeganevans.com/articles/vim.html) as soon as it is
ready. 

## Why $\LaTeX$?

### Seperation of content/structure and appearance
In addition to there being many ways to create basic text, there are
also a miriad of ways to produce a finished, formatted document. Many
applications such as Microsoft Word combine these two functions, as well
as providing tools for structuring your document as well. $\LaTeX$
provides a way to create the content and structure of a document
independent of what it looks like and then produce a document with the
formatting that you want. This does two things.

The first is that it
allows for the creation of content without having to worry about how it
will ultimately look. This allows you to concentrate on the actual
content you are creating rather than worrying about making sure that it
is going to look right when you output it. The second half of the first
point(which probably could really be its own point) is that when you are
creating the content you are explicitly creating the structure as well,
which is an upside since structure is actually PART of the content. This
also allows for the creation of documents like Anki flashcards directly
from .tex documents

The second is that it makes consistent formatting easier. You don't have
to go through the Word document from this year and the one from last
year for your annual report to make sure that the formatting is the
same or copy and paste this years content into a copy of last years
document. Instead you can create a formatting document and then use this
to render your final document each time, easily creating consistent
documents.
